### Steganography Converter
This is for all of you steganography converting needs (If you have them lol)

Read the instructions.txt file for that. I wrote that before I wrote the README, so I'm not doing it again. Sorry.

### What is Steganography?
Google: "Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another message or physical object to avoid detection. Steganography can be used to hide virtually any type of digital content, including text, image, video, or audio content. That hidden data is then extracted at its destination."
This program puts the data into images, and can be extracted by the program. So, png, jpg, jpeg, text can be put into them. Them, it can be extracted.
